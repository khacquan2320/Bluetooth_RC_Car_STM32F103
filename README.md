Introduction
The Bluetooth_RC_Car_STM32F103 project is a remote-controlled car model operated via Bluetooth, powered by an STM32F103 microcontroller. The car can be controlled using an Android smartphone, offering users a convenient and flexible way to manage the car's movement.

Features
Wireless Control via Bluetooth: Uses the HC-05 Bluetooth module for communication between the phone and the car.
STM32F103 Microcontroller: Manages the carâ€™s operations, processes signals, and controls the motors.
Custom Android App: User-friendly interface for easy car control.
DC Motor Control: Uses the L298 H-Bridge driver to control the speed and direction of the motors.
